Please see the [Original Project Assignment Description](https://github.com/smeraldoflower/pig-dice-game/blob/main/Original%20Project%20Assignment%20Description.pdf) for further details and explanations about each project class and component.

NOTE: There is a minor bug in the play() method of the GameController class. However, I don't remember what it was at the time of reuploading this project to github. Please let me know if you are able to find it.
